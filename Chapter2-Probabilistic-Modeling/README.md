# Machine Learning in Finance   
## Chapter 2: Probabalistic Modelling

##### This chapter contains the following notebooks demonstrating foundational concepts in Bayesian econometrics:

### ML_in_Finance_Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Estimation
 * This notebook illustrates the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian estimation under Bernoulli trials. Please refer to Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 2 
 * The effect of prior selection in Bayesian estimation is demonstrated by comparing the results from an informative and an uninformative prior pdf
 
### ML_in_Finance-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff.ipynb
 * This notebook illustrates the "bias-variance tradeoff" or "bias-variance dilemma". Please refer to Sections 4 and 5 of Chapter 2
 * A toy dataset is created from a trigonometric function and Gaussian noise, split into training and validation sets.
 * Polynomial models of increasing complexity are fit to the data, demonstrating the tradeoff between in- and out-of-sample performance

### ML_in_Finance_Bayesian_Linear_Regression
 * This notebook provides a visualisation of the iterative process of Bayesian model selection as applied to linear regression. Please refer to Section 7 of Chapter 2
