# Machine Learning in Finance   
## Chapter 2: Probabalistic Modelling

##### This chapter contains the following notebooks demonstrating foundational concepts in Bayesian statistics:

### ML_in_Finance_Bayesian_vs_Frequentist_Estimation
 * This notebook illustrates the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian estimation under Bernoulli trials. Please refer to Sections 3 and 4 of Chapter 2 
 * The effect of prior selection in Bayesian estimation is demonstrated by comparing the results from an informative and an uninformative prior pdf
 
### ML_in_Finance-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff.ipynb
 * This notebook illustrates the "bias-variance tradeoff" or "bias-variance dilemma". Please refer to Sections 4 and 5 of Chapter 2
 * A toy dataset, split into training and validation sets, is created by adding Gaussian noise to a trigonometric function
 * Polynomial models of increasing complexity are fit to the data, demonstrating the tradeoff between in- and out-of-sample performance
