# ML_in_Finance-Kalman_Filters
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the application of particle filtering to stochastic volatility modeling. The insight gained from Chapter 2, namely a **sequential** or **iterative** application of Bayes's theorem, referred to as "sequential Bayesian updates", is the foundation of real-time **Bayesian filtering**. Kalman filtering is well known example of Bayesian filtering and we begin by reviewing it here.


# ML_in_Finance-Viterbi
This notebook provides a simple example of the Viterbi algorithm applied to an coin which is either fair or loaded (hidden states). Based on a sequence of observations, the algorithm will determine the most likely sequence of hidden states, i.e. whether the coin that generated the data was likely fair or loaded. The example easily maps onto financial markets, e.g. Bull or Bear, Normal or Dislocated etc.
