# Machine Learning in Finance   
## Chapter 9: Reinforcement Lewarning

##### This chapter contains the following notebooks demonstrating the use of reinforcement learning applied to simple problems in finance:

### ML_in_Finance_FCW

 * This notebook shows the application of reinforcement learning to the financial cliff walking problem. The problem is described in Example 9.4 in the textbook.
 * A discretised, time-dependent action value function is 
 * The convergence of the algorithms is compared by plotting the average reward gained against number of training episodes
 * The actions learned for each state by the two algorithms are inspected

###  ML_in_Finance_Market_Impact
 * This notebook shows the application of SARSA and Q-learning to the optimal stock execution problem described in Example 9.5 in the textbook.
 * The convergence of the algorithms is compared by plotting the average reward gained against number of training episodes


### ML_in_Finance_MarketMaking
 * This notebook shows the application of reinforcement learning to the problem of high frequency market making. The problem is described in Example 9.6 in the textbook.
 * SARSA and Q-learning are applied to learn time-independent optimal policies based on historical limit order book data.
 * The convergence of the algorithms is compared by plotting the reward gained after each training episode
 * An animation demonstrating the behaviour of the learned policies is shown
